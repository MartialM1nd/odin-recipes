# odin-recipes
- In this project I created a recipe website using HTML. This allowed me to show my skills in structuring a webpage with elements such as `<a>`, `<img>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, and others.
- I demonstrate how to link different webpages from an index page.
- I demonstrate how to embed images into the webpages, resize them, and add alt text.
- I demonstrate how to use the `<ul>` and `<ol>` and `<dl>` elements to create different types of lists.
